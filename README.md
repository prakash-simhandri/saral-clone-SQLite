## Installing the SQLite3 Driver for Node.js
Now that I have created our project, I did install the node-sqlite3 package from npm using the following command:
```
  sudo apt-get update
  npm install sqlite3 --save
 ```
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

To install express, run the following command on your terminal in Linux.

```
sudo apt-get install npm
npm install express --save
```
To run your code, first open your server port using `node file_name.js` in your working directory in terminal. And, then you can apply the basic CRUD operations.
